# Decay
Unity Assets and source code for Decay. 
A 2D Horror game where you sacrifice corpses to revive your dead mother.

A huge thanks to YouTuber [ManlyBadassHero](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2WuwltdfC8&ab_channel=ManlyBadassHero) for playing the game as a letsplay and garnering 200k+ views and traffic to this game. It's truly an honor to see people enjoy decay as much as we enjoyed making it!
